Due to recent events Wan Shi Tong found that his library had to close 
to the public until further notice, and now must operate virtually. 
One of his fox librarians took note of all the books in the library, 
but it's all out of order. Can you put the titles in alphabetical 
order? A simple Linux command should suffice.

Wan Shi Tong is nothing but meticulous, and wants to make sure you 
did your job correctly. "What is the 13th title on the newly ordered 
list?" he asks. This title will be the key to solving this question, 
and will prove that you are ready to move on to the next category.
